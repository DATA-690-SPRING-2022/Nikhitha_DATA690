# What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analysing (provide sufficient background information)?
Agriculture is a key economic industry in many countries, and agricultural operations offer food and money to huge portions of the population, thus after conducting comprehensive research to select which project ideas to pursue, I chose to investigate on this issue. In this topic, I'd want to compare and contrast the percentage of agricultural land area, land under cereal production, and cereal output through time in various nations. In addition, I'd want to talk about male and female work in agriculture, as well as the import and export of agricultural raw materials.
# Why is it important to you and/or to others?
Many people are unaware of how essential agriculture is to a country's economy, therefore I think it's crucial to investigate this topic. I'd want to give you a thorough overview of agriculture, including how much agricultural land there is, how much land produces grains, and how agricultural productivity is calculated.
# What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
The overall quantity of agricultural land in each location is one of the topics I'm thinking about and would like answered.
2. The number of hectares of land utilized to cultivate grains.
3. How many kg of grains are produced per hectare?
4. Plotting the male and female employment percentages in agriculture.
5. The total agricultural raw material imports and exports in each country.
# Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
Datasets can be downloaded from World Development Explorer (WDX). As most of the data is available in datasets, it would be easier for processing the data.
# What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue?
I analyzed the problem using Data Processing, bubble chart, scatter plot, and bar chart and line chart.
# Agricultural raw materials Imports in 2016

Here, I chose Australia, Canada, China, Germany, and India to compare agricultural raw material imports.

In 2016, China has the highest imports at 3.5 percent of merchandise imports, while Australia has the lowest at 0.7 percent, with the rest of the world like India at 2 percent, Germany at 1.4 percent, and Canada at 0.9 percent.

Overall, China imports the most agricultural raw materials relative to the other countries.
# Cereal yield across different countries from 2010- 2018

I used a Line Graph to show the difference in cereal yield between Canada, China, Germany, and India over time.

Germany produces the highest cereal yield every year as compared to Canada, China, and India. Germany had the highest cereal yield in 2014, with 8050 kg per hectare while India's cereal yield in 2010 was the lowest at 2676 kg per hectare.

Every country's cereal yield fluctuates over time, increasing and decreasing, but it doesn't vary much in China, it only increases slightly.
# Cereal production (kg per hectare) of two countries in 2010

In order to investigate the issue, I utilized a bubble chart to compare the % of agricultural area, acreage under cereal production, and cereal output between two nations, India and the United States.

The red color represents the United States, while the blue color represents India. As a result, India had a far larger percentage of agricultural land (60.4%) than the US (44.5%) in 2010, and acreage under cereal cultivation in India is 100 million hectares, compared to 57.5 million hectares in the US. The cereal production per hectare in the United States, on the other hand, is 6978 kg, which is much more than India's 2676 kg output.
# Employment of male and female in agriculture among different countries in 2013

I used a Scatter plot to compare the % of male and female employment in agriculture in three countries: India, Canada, and the United States, in order to study the topic.

The red color symbolizes India, the blue color represents Canada, and the green color represents the United States, as seen in the diagram above. As a result, in 2013, India was the only country where female agricultural employment outnumbered male agricultural employment by about 16 percent with a ratio of 59:43, whereas in Canada, male agricultural employment outnumbers female employment by 2.4 percent to 1.08 percent with a ratio of 2:1, and female agricultural employment in the United States is 0.67 percent, while male employment is 1.87 percent.

From the above information it is clear that India's agricultural employment is much higher than that of Canada and the United States.

# Agricultural raw material imports and exports in 2000

I used a Bar Graph to analyze the imports and exports of agricultural raw materials in four distinct countries: India, China, Canada, and the United States.

As seen in the diagram above, the red color symbolizes China, the blue color represents Canada, the green color represents India, and the purple color represents the United States. As a consequence, agricultural raw material imports made up 1.36 percent of total merchandise imports in 2000, while exports made up 6.6 percent of total exports. Agricultural raw material imports made up 4.8 percent of total goods imports in China, while exports made up 1.3 percent of total exports. Overall, agricultural raw material imports made up 3.2 percent of goods imports in India, while exports made up 1.2 percent of total exports. Imports of agricultural raw materials made up 1.3 percent of total goods imports in the United States, while exports made up 2.3 percent of all exports.

Overall, the highest exports are recorded in Canada, while the lowest are recorded in China. China has the highest number of imports, while Canada has the lowest.
